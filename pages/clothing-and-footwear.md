Afterthoughts:

I never wore the hoodies much - it was far too humid and everything just clung. The Nosilife shirts I quite liked as they were huge and airy, but Jackie said they made me look fat :(

The waterproofs were never needed - it did rain briefly, on our way up to Laban Rata, but by spur of luck we made it inside, in time.

The downjacket I was thankful for - wearing it in the cold of the night climb, but I didn't need it for the rest of the trip. The mid layer, I never wore. It was never as cold as Kilimanjaro and even then only at one point during the early hours of the climb. I'd hazard that you could get away with a lighter down jacket to lighten your load.

Swimming clothing was a must! We visited many places to swim which we were grateful for, given the humidity. I'd also recommend a light waterproof day-bag to carry towels and sunblock and things.
