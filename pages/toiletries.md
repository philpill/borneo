Afterthoughts:

I don't like to second guess my toiletries, as they're small and you never know if you might need them, but we did run out of sunblock. Chlorine tablets were not required, as we got clean, boiled water wherever we stayed.

Toiletries are easily acquired in the cities - it might be better to buy the stuff there and discard the remains at the end of the trip instead of carrying needless weight in your luggage.
