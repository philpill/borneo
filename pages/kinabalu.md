[Mount Kinabalu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu) will be on the agenda on the fourth day of our trek. At 4095m, I don't think I'll need Diamox - I've been higher with few altitude worries. The only minor annoyance is I'll be having to pack extra cold weather clothing especially for this portion of the trip.

I think trekking poles will be a must for this, for me.

There're lots of videos of Kinabalu:
