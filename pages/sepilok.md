We left Turtle Island at 7 with a backwards glance to see the board had been updated with the latest turtle info. Carrying(or dragging) our bags/suitcases across the beach, we loaded into our boat and set off back to Sandakan Hotel to retrieve the stuff we had left there for storage before taking taxisÂ out to [Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g298307-d1887063-Reviews-Sepilok_Orangutan_Rehabilitation_Centre-Kota_Kinabalu_Kota_Kinabalu_District_West.html), some twenty-odd miles west of Sandakan.
