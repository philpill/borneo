Hopefully, by point I'll have been on enough trips I won't have to worry about getting anymore vaccinations.

[NetDoctor](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/travel/asia/borneo.shtml):

- Typhoid
- Hepatitis A
- Tuberculosis
- Hepatitis B
- Rabies
- Cholera
- Yellow fever
- Japanese B encephalitis

Going by my handy [Nomad](http://www.nomadtravel.co.uk/c-4-travel-health-clinic.aspx) vaccination card, it looks like I could be due a typhoid and rabies booster. I've never had anything for cholera though, but I'll see what they say.

EDIT: Seems like I'm pretty up-to-date with everything. Didn't need any injections, just anti-malarials. I'll be taking my Yellow Fever certicate from last year tho', just in case I get asked for it.
