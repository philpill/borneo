Today, we'd be leaving Poring, and heading to the jungle camp in Kinabatangan in Sandakan. Most of today would be taken up with the 5-6 hour drive to Sandakan which was quite hard going - our minibus didn't have headrests, so no sleep would be forthcoming.

After a long ride, we swapped our minibus for speedboats!

We crossed the [Kinabatangan River](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinabatangan_River) to the jungle camp. Muscle cramp was still causing no end of hilarity as everyone was climbing in and out of boats and walking up steep wooden steps with the stiffest of legs.

I have a terrible recollection of what this accommodation was like, but I do remember there were a lot of other groups here. The camp was of the open-hut arrangement, and there were walkways connecting different areas. After dropping our stuff off, we went for a cruise down the river to see if we could spot any wildlife. There were hopes of elephants, but as it were, all we really saw were macaques and some snakes in a tree.

Later on, we went for a night-walk around the trees not too far from camp. We kitted up in anti-leech gear and head-torches and went for a brief wander. The humidity was pretty horrible - I was wearing more clothes than usual to avoid insect bites so I was already sweating. There were a few creepy sightings of leeches and spiders and some small things in the trees. The highlight was probably a [tarsier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsier) sighting. Sue later found a leech on her when she went for a shower, despite all of us wearing leech socks.
